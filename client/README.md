A multiplayer game that allows you stack and build a delicious multilayer sandwich. 
The items that will be stacked will be the ingredients used in a sandwhich.
The item to be stacked moves left and right until the player makes a mouse click and drops the ingredient on the stack.
The player who first drops the item away from the stack loses or the one to stack the most layers in a specified time wins.
